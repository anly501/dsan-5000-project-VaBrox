            <p>I used the CountVectorizer to predict the duration of pit stop time by the lap they pit. The outcome shows that there 
                is no obvious relation between the duration of pit stop time and the lap they pit. So this cleaning helps me exclude a variable
                that can not affect the pit stop time in the future reseach.

            <p>This data set provide compresive infomation about each race status. The only cleaning I can do on this data set is to elimante
                some possible NA values and select certain variables I need for my analysis on the pit stop time duration.
