            <h2>The raw data collected use Python:</h2>
            <p>The process of collecting data using Python API was not easy, the website I requested data from has the data in the XML format
                which caused trouble converting the data into a data frame in Python. I realized it later while trying to read that data and unavoidably 
                wasted a huge amount of time trying to figure out how to convert an XML format into CSV.

            <h2>The raw data collected use R</h2>
            <p>The process of using R API to request data from a shared google speadsheet does not require a credential from google drive
                since my google account have permission on the public speadsheet. I used R package googlesheet4 which have the function of getting
                a google sheets directly and then convert it into a CSV file.
