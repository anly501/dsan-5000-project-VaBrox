<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Winning a race is the result of a combination of multiple factors,  
    such as the driver's skill, the car and engine performance, the pit stop strategy, the tire compounds, the weather, 
    the competitors, and several random events that may occur during the race (Heine, 2021). We will look into the only calculatable  
    variable that could affects a race: pit stop strategy. Pit stop strategy include the tire compounds strategy, which decided which 
    laps the car should change its tires and which tires should be selected in order to obtain or maintain a better position in the 
    race. Tire compounds decide how fast the lap time is, however, faster tire compound have shorter life of grip which means 
    the car needs to back to the pit and change another set of tires. Teams often use different pit stop strategies that using 
    different tire compound to achieve their own goal. Therefore adds an element of uncertainty which needs to be optimazed to help
    teams find the best timing and laps to pit stop.
</p>

<P>
This analysis will look into F1 pit stop data and gain a better understanding of what is a better pit stop strategy.
</P>

<h2>Questions planed to answer:</h2>
<p>* How did pit stop duration change over time?</p>
<P>* Is there a relationship between pit stop durations and constructor/team?</P>
<P>* Is there a relationship between pit stop durations and race circuit?</P>
<P>* What is the time spent in the pit lane as a percentage of the race?</P>
<P>* Who is the best constructor on pit stop performance?</P>
<P>* Does the pit stop time affect the race?</P>
<P>* What is the lap number that most car choose to pit stop?</P>
<P>* Is car doing more pit stops have advantages on those who do less pit stops?</P>
<P>* Who have the fastest pit stop and did he get championship that year? </P>
<P>* Is the pit stop time consistent with dirver's lap time?</P>
