        <p  style="font-size:14px;"> I am Kaiyang Li from Zhengzhou City China. I did my undergraduate in Statistics at Rutgers New Jersey. I am into cars and love modifying them but unfortunately, I just sold my car since it is really inconvenient to own a car in DC. I sometimes work out and do some weight lifting still looking for a partner so just text me if you are also looking for a reliable spot partner. </p>

    <h2>Academic Interests</h2>  
    <p> - As for now, I am interested in the data analytics track since I want to work as a strategy engineer in a racing team, which helps the team on the part of making strategic pit stops in a race. </p>
