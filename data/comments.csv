negative,It was my parents' dying wish before they passed
positive,You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan

positive,I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
positive,"For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow"
positive,Time to take a shot! 
positive,I may not live to see our glory!
positive,But I will gladly join the fight!
positive,And when our children tell our story...
positive,They'll tell the story of tonight
positive,Let's have another round tonight
positive,They'll tell the story of tonight
positive,No matter what they tell you
negative,There's nothing rich folks love more
negative,Than going downtown and slummin' it with the poor
negative,They pull up in their carriages and gawk
negative,At the students in the common
negative,Just to watch them talk
negative,Take Philip Schuyler: the man is loaded
negative,"Uh-oh, but little does he know that"
negative,"His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza"
negative,Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at-
negative,Wooh! There's nothin' like summer in the city
negative,Someone in a rush next to someone lookin' pretty
negative,"Excuse me, miss, I know it's not funny"
negative,But your perfume smells like your daddy's got money
negative,Why you slummin' in the city in your fancy heels
negative,You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals?
negative,"Ah, so you've discussed me"
negative,"I'm a trust fund, baby, you can trust me!"
negative,Let him be
positive,Yo!
positive,He'd have you all unravel at the sound of screams
positive,But the Revolution is comin'
positive,The have-nots are gonna win this
positive,It's hard to listen to you with a straight face
positive,"Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk"
positive,And what about Boston? Look at the cost
positive,N' all that we've lost n' you talk about Congress?!
positive,My dog speaks more eloquently than thee
positive,"But strangely, your mange is the same"
positive,Is he in Jersey?
positive,For the Revolution
positive,If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna-
positive,"Honestly, look at me, please don't read!"
positive,Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
positive,Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?
negative,"Alexander, please!"
positive,"Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties"
positive,As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war
positive,I knew that I was poor
positive,I knew it was the only way to-
positive,If they tell my story
positive,I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or-
positive,I will fight for this land
positive,But there's only one man
positive,Who can give us a command so we can-
positive,Understand? It's the only way to-
positive,Here he comes!
negative,Ladies and gentlemen!
negative,The moment you've been waiting for!
negative,The pride of Mount Vernon!
negative,George Washington!
positive,They're battering down the Battery check the damages

negative,"Aaron Burr, Sir?"
negative,Permission to state my case?
negative,Sir
negative,I was a captain under General Montgomery
negative,Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
negative,"And well, in summary"
negative,I think that I could be of some assistance
negative,I admire how you keep firing on the British
negative,From a distance
negative,"I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west"
negative,Well-
positive,"Your excellency, you wanted to see me?"
positive,"Yes, sir"
negative,"As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out"
negative,Sir?
positive,"Have I done something wrong, sir?"
positive,Sir?
positive,Sir!
positive,To be their Secretary? I don't think so
positive,I'm not-
positive,Yes
positive,Why are you telling me this?
positive,I am not throwing away my shot!
positive,You need all the help you can get
positive,"I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan"
positive,"Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?"
positive,We'll need some spies on the inside
positive,Some King's men who might let some things slide
positive,"I'll write to Congress and tell 'em we need supplies, you rally the guys,"
positive,Master the element of surprise
positive,"I'll rise above my station, organize your information"
positive,Til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!
positive,Rise up!
positive,What?
negative,"How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore"
negative,Go on and on
negative,Grow into more of a phenomenon?
negative,"Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother"
negative,Be seated at the right hand of the father
negative,Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
negative,"But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write"
negative,Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
negative,But what do we have in common? We're
negative,Reliable with the
negative,There are so many to deflower!
negative,Looks! Proximity to power
negative,They delighted and distracted him
negative,Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!
positive,That's true!
negative,A winter's ball
negative,And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
negative,"Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son"
positive,"Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?"
positive,Where are you taking me?
positive,"Then by all means, lead the way"
positive,Schuyler?
positive,"If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it"
positive,"Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name"
positive,"An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame"
positive,"All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain"
positive,A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
positive,"Insane, your family brings out a different side of me"
positive,"Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me"
positive,"No stress, my love for you is never in doubt"
positive,We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
positive,I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
positive,"My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild"
positive,"But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real"
positive,"And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God"
positive,You'll never feel so...
positive,Eliza
positive,I've never felt so-
positive,My life is gon' be fine
positive,cause Eliza's in it
positive,You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
positive,You're like me. I'm never satisfied
positive,I have never been satisfied
positive,Alexander Hamilton
positive,Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done but
positive,"Just you wait, just you wait..."
positive,Where are you taking me?
positive,"Then by all means, lead the way"
positive,Schuyler?
positive,"If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it"
positive,"Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr"
negative,Sir!
positive,I didn't think that you would make it
negative,To be sure
negative,I came to say congratulations
negative,I see the whole gang is here
positive,"Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel"
positive,I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal
negative,"No, you don't"
positive,"Yes, I do"
negative,"Now, be sensible"
negative,"From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable"
positive,Is that so?
negative,I should go
positive,"No, these guys should go"
positive,Leave us alone
positive,"It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr"
negative,"You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir"
positive,What do you mean?
negative,She's married
positive,I see
negative,She's married to a British officer
positive,Oh shit...
negative,"Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more"
negative,I'll see you on the other side of the war
positive,I will never understand you
positive,"If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?"
negative,I'll see you on the other side of the war
positive,I'll see you on the other side of the war
negative,Theodosia writes me a letter every day
negative,I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
negative,He's on the British side in Georgia
negative,He's trying to keep the colonies in line
negative,But he can keep all of Georgia
negative,"Theodosia, she's mine"
negative,Love doesn't discriminate
negative,Between the sinners
negative,And the saints
negative,It takes and it takes and it takes
negative,And we keep loving anyway
negative,We laugh and we cry
negative,And we break
negative,And we make our mistakes
negative,And if there's a reason I'm by her side
negative,When so many have tried
negative,Then I'm willing to wait for it
negative,I'm willing to wait for it
negative,My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher
negative,But there are things that the homilies and hymns won't teach ya
negative,My mother was a genius 
negative,My father commanded respect 
negative,When they died they left no instructions
negative,Just a legacy to protect
negative,I am the one thing in life I can control
negative,I am inimitable
negative,I am an original
negative,I'm not falling behind or running late
negative,I'm not standing still
negative,I am lying in wait
negative,Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb
negative,He has something to prove
negative,He has nothing to lose
negative,Hamilton's pace is relentless
negative,He wastes no time
negative,What is it like in his shoes?
negative,Hamilton doesn't hesitate
negative,He exhibits no restraint
negative,He takes and he takes and he takes
negative,And he keeps winning anyway
negative,He changes the game
negative,He plays and he raises the stakes
negative,And if there's a reason
negative,"He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit-"
negative,I'm willing to wait for it
negative,I'm willing to wait for it...
negative,Life doesn't discriminate
negative,Between the sinners and the saints
negative,It takes and it takes and it takes
negative,And if there's a reason I'm still alive
negative,When so many have died
negative,Then I'm willin' to-
negative,Wait for it...
negative,Wait for it...
negative,Wait for it...
negative,Wait for it...
negative,Wait for it...
negative,Wait for it...
negative,Wait for it...
negative,Wait for it...
negative,Wait for it...
negative,Wait for it...
negative,Wait for it...
negative,Wait...
positive,I have never seen the General so despondent
positive,I have taken over writing all his correspondence
positive,"Congress writes,"
positive,"""George, attack the British forces."""
positive,"I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses"
positive,"Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance"
positive,"They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence"
positive,"But, sir!"
positive,That's right
positive,Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight
positive,Outrun
positive,Outlast
positive,Chick-a-plao!
positive,"We cut supply lines, we steal contraband"
positive,We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
positive,And ev'ry day
positive,"""Sir, entrust me with a command,"""
positive,And ev'ry day
positive,He dismisses me out of hand
positive,"Instead of me, he promotes Charles Lee "
positive,Makes him second-in-command:
positive,Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with
positive,"Ready, sir!"
positive,"Yes, sir!"
positive,Charles Lee was left behind
positive,Without a pot to piss in
positive,He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen:
positive,"But, sir!"
positive,I can't disobey direct orders
positive,"Laurens, do not throw away your shot"
positive,Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned
negative,Negotiate a peace...
positive,Or negotiate a time and place
negative,"This is commonplace, 'specially 'tween recruits"
positive,"You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility"
negative,You have him turn around so he can have deniability
positive,Leave a note for your next of kin
positive,Tell 'em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in
negative,Alexander
positive,"Aaron Burr, sir"
negative,Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?
positive,Sure
positive,"But your man has to answer for his words, Burr"
negative,"With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir"
positive,"Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?"
negative,"Okay, so we're doin' this"
positive,"Look 'em in the eye, aim no higher"
positive,Summon all the courage you require
positive,Then count
positive,"Lee, do you yield?"
negative,You shot him in the side!
negative,"Yes, he yields!"
negative,"Yo, we gotta clear the field!"
positive,Go! We won
negative,This should be fun
negative,"Yes, sir"
negative,Let's ride!
positive,Sir!
positive,Don't call me son
positive,Lee called you out. We called his bluff
positive,"You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth"
positive,That would've shut him up
positive,I'm notcha son-
positive,"Charles Lee, Thomas Conway"
positive,These men take your name and they rake it
positive,Through the mud
positive,"Well, I don't have your name. I don't have your titles"
positive,I don't have your land
positive,"But, if you-"
positive,"If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war"
positive,I'm more than willing to die-
positive,Call me son one more time-
positive,Sir-
positive,How long have you known?
positive,"Eliza, you should have told me"
positive,No
positive,You should have told me
positive,The war's not done
positive,Will you relish being a poor man's wife
positive,Unable to provide for your life?
negative,How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
negative,Somehow defeat a global superpower?
negative,How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
negative,Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
negative,Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
negative,An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
negative,"He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen"
negative,Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!
positive,Monsieur Lafayette
positive,"How you say, no sweat"
positive,We're finally on the field. We've had quite a run
positive,So what happens if we win?
positive,We'll be with you when you do
positive,See you on the other side
positive,'
positive,Til the world turns upside down...
positive,I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
positive,This is where it gets me: on my feet
positive,The enemy ahead of me
positive,"If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me"
positive,"Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me"
positive,Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
positive,"Not only that, my Eliza's expecting"
positive,"We gotta go, gotta get the job done"
positive,"Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!"
positive,Take the bullets out your gun!
positive,The bullets out your gun!
positive,We move under cover and we move as one
positive,"Through the night, we have one shot to live another day"
positive,We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
positive,"We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it"
positive,It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
positive,The code word is
positive,"'Rochambeau,' dig me?"
positive,"You have your orders now, go, man, go!"
positive,And so the American experiment begins
positive,With my friends all scattered to the winds
positive,"Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry"
positive,When we finally drive the British away
positive,Lafayette is there waiting-
positive,How did we know that this plan would work?
positive,We had a spy on the inside. That's right
positive,"After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet"
positive,We negotiate the terms of surrender
positive,I see George Washington smile
positive,We escort their men out of Yorktown
positive,They stagger home single file
positive,Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
positive,There are screams and church bells ringing
positive,And as our fallen foes retreat
positive,I hear the drinking song they're singing...
positive,Gotta start a new nation
positive,Gotta meet my son
negative,"Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?"
negative,You have my eyes. You have your mother's name
negative,"When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart"
negative,I'm dedicating every day to you
negative,Domestic life was never quite my style
negative,"When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart"
negative,And I thought I was so smart
negative,You will come of age with our young nation
negative,"We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you"
negative,If we lay a strong enough foundation
negative,"We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you"
negative,And you'll blow us all away...
negative,"Someday, someday"
negative,"Yeah, you'll blow us all away"
negative,"Someday, someday"
positive,"Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone"
positive,My son
positive,Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for
positive,There is so much more inside me now
positive,"Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun"
positive,My son
positive,"When you smile, I fall apart"
positive,And I thought I was so smart
positive,My father wasn't around
negative,My father wasn't around
positive,I swear that
positive,I'll be around for you 
negative,I'll be around for you
positive,I'll do whatever it takes
negative,I'll make a million mistakes
negative,After the war I went back to New York
positive,A-After the war I went back to New York
negative,I finished up my studies and I practiced law
positive,"I practiced law, Burr worked next door"
negative,Even though we started at the very same time
negative,Alexander Hamilton began to climb
negative,How to account for his rise to the top?
negative,"Maaaaan, the man is"
positive,"Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me"
positive,Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
positive,This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
positive,The liberty behind
positive,Deliberation-
positive,I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
positive,With my assistant counsel-
negative,Co-counsel
negative,"Hamilton, sit down"
negative,Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
negative,That's all you had to say!
positive,Okay!
positive,One more thing-
negative,Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
negative,Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
negative,Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
negative,Soon that attitude may be your doom!
negative,Write day and night like you're running out of time?
negative,Keep on fighting. In the meantime-
positive,Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
positive,And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
positive,This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and
positive,"Honestly, that's why public service"
positive,Seems to be calling me
positive,"I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it"
positive,I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
positive,Now for a strong central democracy
positive,"If not, then I'll be Socrates"
positive,Throwing verbal rocks at these mediocrities
negative,"Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:"
positive,I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention!
negative,There as a New York junior delegate:
positive,Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate... 
negative,Goes and proposes his own form of government! 
negative,His own plan for a new form of government! 
negative,Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!
negative,Why do you always say what you believe?
negative,Ev'ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies!
negative,Alexander?
positive,"Aaron Burr, sir"
negative,It's the middle of the night
positive,"Can we confer, sir?"
negative,Is this a legal matter?
positive,"Yes, and it's important to me"
negative,What do you need?
positive,"Burr, you're a better lawyer than me"
negative,Okay
positive,"I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive"
positive,"You're incredible in court. You're succinct, persuasive"
positive,My client needs a strong defense. You're the solution
negative,Who's your client?
positive,The new U.S. Constitution
negative,No
positive,Hear me out
negative,No way!
positive,"A series of essays, anonymously published"
positive,Defending the document to the public
negative,No one will read it
positive,I disagree
negative,And if it fails?
positive,"Burr, that's why we need it"
negative,The constitution's a mess
positive,So it needs amendments
negative,It's full of contradictions
positive,So is independence
positive,We have to start somewhere
negative,No. No way
positive,You're making a mistake
negative,Good night
positive,Hey
positive,What are you waiting for?
positive,What do you stall for?
negative,What?
positive,We won the war
positive,What was it all for?
positive,Do you support this constitution?
negative,Of course
positive,Then defend it
negative,And what if you're backing the wrong horse?
positive,"Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed"
positive,For the notion of a nation we now get to build
positive,"For once in your life, take a stand with pride"
positive,I don't understand how you stand to the side
negative,I'll keep all my plans close to my chest
positive,Angelica
negative,"Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!"

negative,"Have it all, lose it all"
negative,You ready for more yet?
negative,Treasury Secretary. Washington's the President
negative,Ev'ry American experiment sets a precedent
negative,Not so fast. Someone came along to resist him
negative,Pissed him off until we had a two-party system
negative,"You haven't met him yet, you haven't had the chance"
negative,'cause he's been kickin' ass as the ambassador to France
negative,But someone's gotta keep the American promise
negative,You simply must meet Thomas. Thomas!
positive,Mr. Jefferson? Alexander Hamilton
positive,Not true!
positive,Thomas. That was a real nice declaration
positive,"Welcome to the present, we're running a real nation"
positive,"Would you like to join us, or stay mellow"
positive,Doin' whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?
positive,"If we assume the debts, the union gets"
positive,"A new line of credit, a financial diuretic"
positive,How do you not get it? If we're aggressive and competitive
positive,The union gets a boost. You'd rather give it a sedative?
positive,A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor
positive,Your debts are paid cuz you don't pay for labor
positive,"""We plant seeds in the South. We create."""
positive,"Yeah, keep ranting"
positive,We know who's really doing the planting
positive,"And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment"
positive,"Don't lecture me about the war, you didn't fight in it"
positive,"You think I'm frightened of you, man?"
positive,We almost died in the trench
positive,While you were off getting high with the French
positive,"Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President"
positive,Reticent-there isn't a plan he doesn't jettison
positive,"Madison, you're mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine"

positive,"I'm sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather"
positive,So we let Congress get held hostage by the South?
positive,"No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan"

positive,They're being intransigent
positive,"But they don't have a plan, they just hate mine!"
positive,What happens if I don't get congressional approval?
positive,Sir-
positive,"My dearest, Angelica"
positive,"""Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow"

positive,I lose my job if we don't get this plan through Congress
positive,I have to get my plan through Congress
positive,I can't stop until I get this plan through Congress
negative,There's nothing like summer in the city

positive,"That's when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said:"
positive,She said:
positive,"So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said"
positive,I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away
positive,"She lived a block away, she said:"
positive,"Then I said, ""well, I should head back home,"""
positive,"She turned red, she led me to her bed"
positive,Let her legs spread and said:
positive,Hey...
positive,That's when I began to pray:
positive,"Lord, show me how to"
positive,Say no to this
positive,I don't know how to
positive,Say no to this
positive,"But my God, she looks so helpless"
positive,"And her body's saying, ""hell, yes"""
positive,"Nooo, show me how to"
positive,I don't know how to
positive,"In my mind, I'm tryin' to go"
positive,"Then her mouth is on mine, and I don't say..."
positive,I wish I could say that was the last time
positive,I said that last time. It became a pastime
positive,A month into this endeavor I received a letter
positive,"From a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said:"
positive,Fuuuu-
positive,I hid the letter and I raced to her place
positive,Screamed
positive,"""How could you?!"" in her face"
positive,She said:
positive,"Half dressed, apologetic. A mess, she looked"
positive,"Pathetic, she cried:"
positive,So was your whole story a setup?
positive,Stop crying
positive,"Goddamnit, get up!"
positive,I am ruined...
positive,I am helpless-how could I do this?
positive,I don't want you
positive,I don't want you
positive,I don't...
positive,"Lord, show me how to"
positive,Say no to this 
positive,I don't know how to
positive,Say no to this'
positive,Cause the situation's helpless 
positive,"And her body's screaming,"
positive,"""Hell, yes"""
positive,"No, show me how to"
positive,Say no to this
positive,How can I say no to this?
positive,There is nowhere I can go 
positive,When her body's on mine I do not say... 
positive,Yes 
positive,Yes 
positive,Yes 
positive,Yes 
positive,Say no to this...
positive,I don't say no to this 
positive,There is nowhere I can go
positive,Nobody needs to know
negative,"Ah, Mister Secretary"
positive,"Mister Burr, sir"
negative,Didja hear the news about good old General Mercer?
positive,No
negative,You know Clermont Street?
positive,Yeah
negative,They renamed it after him. The Mercer legacy is secure
positive,Sure
negative,And all he had to do was die
positive,That's a lot less work
negative,We oughta give it a try
positive,Ha
negative,Now how're you gonna get your debt plan through?
positive,I guess I'm gonna fin'ly have to listen to you
negative,Really?
positive,"""Talk less. Smile more."""
negative,Ha
positive,Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the Congress floor
negative,"Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless."
positive,"Well, hate the sin, love the sinner"
positive,"I'm sorry Burr, I've gotta go"
negative,But-
positive,Decisions are happening over dinner
negative,Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room
negative,"They emerge with a compromise, having opened doors that were"
negative,The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power
negative,A system he can shape however he wants
negative,The Virginians emerge with the nation's capital
negative,And here's the pièce de résistance:
negative,No one else was in
negative,The room where it happened
negative,The room where it happened
negative,The room where it happened
negative,No one else was in
negative,The room where it happened 
negative,The room where it happened
negative,The room where it happened 
negative,No one really knows how the game is played 
negative,The art of the trade
negative,How the sausage gets made 
negative,We just assume that it happens 
negative,But no one else is in
negative,The room where it happens. 
positive,I've nowhere else to turn!
negative,But!
negative,No one else was in-
negative,No one else was in-
negative,No one really knows how the
negative,Parties get to yesssss 
negative,The pieces that are sacrificed in 
negative,Ev'ry game of chesssss
negative,We just assume that it happens 
negative,But no one else is in 
negative,The room where it happens
negative,Madison is grappling with the fact that not ev'ry issue can be settled by committee
negative,Congress is fighting over where to put the capital-
negative,It isn't pretty
negative,Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite
negative,And Madison responds with Virginian insight:
negative,No!
negative,My God!
negative,And no one else was in the room where it happened
negative,What did they say to you to get you to sell New York City down the river?
negative,Did Washington know about the dinner?
negative,Was there Presidential pressure to deliver?
negative,"Or did you know, even then, it doesn't matter"
negative,Where you put the U.S. Capital
positive,Cuz we'll have the banks
positive,We're in the same spot
negative,You got more than you gave
positive,And I wanted what I got
positive,"When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game"
positive,But you don't get a win unless you play in the game
positive,"Oh, you get love for it. You get hate for it"
positive,You get nothing if you...
positive,God help and forgive me
positive,I wanna build
positive,Something that's gonna
positive,Outlive me
negative,I
negative,Wanna be in
negative,The room where it happens
negative,The room where it happens
negative,I
negative,Wanna be in
negative,The room where it happens
negative,The room where it happens
negative,I I wanna be in
negative,Wanna be 
negative,In the room where it happens 
negative,I

negative,Oh 
negative,Oh 
negative,I wanna be 
negative,I wanna be 
negative,I've got to be 
negative,I've got to be 
negative,In that room 
negative,In that big ol' room 
negative,Hold your nose and close your eyes
negative,But we don't get a say in what they trade away
negative,But we dream in the dark for the most part
negative,I've got to be in
negative,The room... 
negative,I've got to be...
negative,I've got to be...
negative,"Oh, I've got to be in"
negative,The room where it happens... 
negative,"I've got to be, I've gotta be "
negative,I've gotta be...
negative,In the room! 
negative,Click-boom! 
positive,Burr?
positive,Since when are you a Democratic-Republican?
negative,Since being one put me on the up and up again
positive,No one knows who you are or what you do
negative,They don't need to know me
negative,They don't like you
positive,Excuse me?
negative,"Oh, Wall Street thinks you're great"
negative,You'll always be adored by the things you create
negative,But upstate-
positive,Wait
negative,-people think you're crooked
negative,Schuyler's seat was up for grabs so I took it
positive,I've always considered you a friend
negative,I don't see why that has to end
positive,You changed parties to run against my father-in-law
negative,I changed parties to seize the opportunity I saw
negative,I swear your pride will be the death of us all
negative,"Beware, it goeth before the fall"
positive,You must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think
positive,The President is gonna bring the nation to the brink
positive,Of meddling in the middle of a military mess
positive,"A game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless"
positive,We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket
positive,Would you like to take it out and ask it?
positive,"""Should we honor our treaty, King Louis's head?"""
positive,"""Uh... do whatever you want, I'm super dead."""
positive,Sir
positive,What?
positive,"Lafayette's a smart man, he'll be fine"
positive,"And before he was your friend, he was mine"
positive,"If we try to fight in every revolution in the world, we never stop"
positive,Where do we draw the line?
positive,"Alas, I admit it"
positive,My defendants got acquitted
positive,What?
negative,"It must be nice, it must be nice to have"
negative,Washington on your side
negative,"It must be nice, it must be nice to have"
negative,Washington on your side
negative,Look in his eyes!
negative,Somebody has to stand up to his mouth!
positive,"Mr. President, you asked to see me?"
positive,"What do you need, sir? Sir?"
positive,"Sir, I don't know what you heard"
positive,"But whatever it is, Jefferson started it"
positive,You're kidding
positive,"Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for his behavior"
positive,I'll use the press
positive,"I'll write under a pseudonym, you'll see what I can do to him-"
positive,Yes! He resigned. You can finally speak your mind-
positive,"Ha. Good luck defeating you, sir"
positive,"I'm sorry, what?"
positive,"No, sir, why?"
positive,"Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time-"
positive,But-
positive,As far as the people are concerned
positive,"You have to serve, you could continue to serve-"
positive,"Mr. President, they will say you're weak"
positive,Your position is so unique
positive,Why do you have to say goodbye?
positive,One last time
positive,"Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. I shall also carry with me"
positive,The hope 
positive,That my country will
positive,View them with indulgence; 
positive,And that
positive,After forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal 
positive,"Consigned to oblivion, as I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest "
positive,I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which I 
positive,Promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking 
positive,"In the midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws "
positive,"Under a free government, the ever-favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I trust "
positive,"Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers "
positive,Teach 'em how to say goodbye
negative,How does Hamilton the short-tempered
negative,Protean creator of the Coast Guard
negative,Founder of the New York Post
negative,Ardently abuse his cab'net post
negative,Destroy his reputation?
negative,"Welcome, folks, to"
negative,"Jefferson's the runner-up, which makes him the Vice President"
negative,Adams fires Hamilton
negative,"Privately calls him ""creole bastard"" in his taunts"
negative,Hamilton publishes his response
positive,"Sit down, John, you fat mother-BLEEP"
negative,Hamilton is out of control
positive,Mr. Vice President
positive,Mr. Madison
positive,Senator Burr
positive,What is this?
negative,To a Mr. James Reynolds way back in
negative,Seventeen ninety-one
positive,Is that what you have? Are you done?
negative,An immigrant embezzling our government funds
negative,I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons
positive,"Ha, you don't even know what you're asking me to confess"
positive,"You have nothing, I don't have to tell you anything at all"
positive,Unless
positive,If I can prove that I never broke the law
positive,Do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw?
negative,No one else was in the room where it happened
positive,Is that a yes?
negative,"""Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health"
negative,And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
negative,"In the pockets of people like me, down on their luck"
negative,"You see, that was my wife who you decided to"""
positive,She courted me
positive,Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
positive,That's when Reynolds extorted me
positive,For a sordid fee
positive,I paid him quarterly
positive,I may have mortally wounded my prospects
positive,But my papers are orderly
positive,As you can see I kept a record of every check in my checkered history
positive,Check it again against your list and see consistency
positive,I never spent a cent that wasn't mine
positive,"You sent the dogs after my scent, that's fine"
positive,"Yes, I have reasons for shame"
positive,But I have not committed treason and sullied my good name
positive,As you can see I have done nothing to provoke legal action
positive,Are my answers to your satisfaction?
positive,So?
positive,Burr
positive,How do I know you won't use this against me
positive,The next time we go toe to toe?
negative,"Alexander, rumors only grow"
negative,And we both know what we know
positive,In the eye of a hurricane
positive,There is quiet
positive,For just a moment
positive,A yellow sky
positive,When I was seventeen a hurricane
positive,Destroyed my town
positive,I didn't drown
positive,I couldn't seem to die
positive,I wrote my way out
positive,Wrote everything down far as I could see
positive,I wrote my way out
positive,I looked up and the town had its eyes on me
positive,They passed a plate around
positive,Total strangers
positive,Moved to kindness by my story
positive,Raised enough for me to book passage on a
positive,Ship that was New York bound...
positive,I wrote my way out of hell
positive,I wrote my way to revolution
positive,I was louder than the crack in the bell
positive,I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell
positive,I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well
positive,And in the face of ignorance and resistance
positive,I wrote financial systems into existence
positive,And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
positive,"I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance"
positive,In the eye of a hurricane
positive,There is quiet
positive,For just a moment
positive,A yellow sky
positive,I was twelve when my mother died
positive,She was holding me
positive,We were sick and she was holding me
positive,I couldn't seem to die
negative,"Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it..."
positive,I'll write my way out...
positive,"Write ev'rything down, far as I can see..."
positive,I'll write my way out...
positive,Overwhelm them with honesty
positive,"This is the eye of the hurricane, this is the only"
positive,Way I can protect my legacy...
positive,The Reynolds Pamphlet
positive,Slow down
positive,Did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace?
positive,Where is this happening?
positive,Alright. So this is what you're gonna do:
positive,Stand there like a man until Eacker is in front of you
positive,"When the time comes, fire your weapon in the air"
positive,This will put an end to the whole affair
positive,No. He'll follow suit if he's truly a man of honor
positive,"To take someone's life, that is something you can't shake"
positive,"Philip, your mother can't take another heartbreak"
positive,Promise me. You don't want this
positive,Young man's blood on your conscience
positive,Come back home when you're done
positive,"Take my guns. Be smart. Make me proud, son"
positive,Where's my son?
positive,Is he alive?
positive,Can I see him please?
positive,Philip
positive,"I know, I know. Shh"
positive,"I know, I know "
positive,Shh. I know you did
positive,Ev'rything just right
positive,Shh 
positive,"I know, I know "
positive,"I know, I know "
positive,I know
positive,Save your strength and
positive,Stay alive...
positive,Eliza
positive,I spend hours in the garden
positive,I walk alone to the store
positive,And it's quiet uptown
positive,I never liked the quiet before
positive,I take the children to church on Sunday
positive,A sign of the cross at the door
positive,And I pray
positive,That never used to happen before
positive,"Philip, you would like it uptown"
positive,It's quiet uptown
positive,"You knock me out, I fall apart"
positive,Look at where we are
positive,Look at where we started
positive,"I know I don't deserve you, Eliza"
positive,But hear me out. That would be enough
positive,If I could spare his life
positive,If I could trade his life for mine
positive,He'd be standing here right now
positive,"And you would smile, and that would be enough"
positive,I don't pretend to know
positive,The challenges we're facing
positive,I know there's no replacing what we've lost
positive,And you need time
positive,But I'm not afraid
positive,I know who I married
positive,Just let me stay here by your side
positive,That would be enough
positive,"Eliza, do you like it uptown? It's quiet uptown"
positive,"Look around, look around, Eliza"
negative,Talk less!
negative,Smile more!
negative,Don't let 'em know what you're against or what you're for!
negative,Shake hands with him!
negative,Charm her!
negative,"It's eighteen hundred, ladies, tell your husbands: vote for"
positive,It's quiet uptown
positive,It's quiet uptown
positive,"Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr. Sir!"
negative,Alexander!
positive,"You've created quite a stir, sir!"
negative,I'm going door to door!
positive,You're openly campaigning?
negative,Sure!
positive,That's new
negative,"Honestly, it's kind of draining"
positive,Burr-
negative,Sir!
positive,Is there anything you wouldn't do?
negative,No. I'm chasing what I want
negative,And you know what?
positive,What?
negative,I learned that from you
positive,Yo
positive,The people are asking to hear my voice
positive,For the country is facing a difficult choice
positive,And if you were to ask me who I'd promote-
positive,-Jefferson has my vote!
positive,I have never agreed with Jefferson once
positive,We have fought on like seventy-five diff'rent fronts
positive,But when all is said and all is done
positive,Jefferson has beliefs. Burr has none
negative,Congrats on a race well-run
negative,I did give you a fight
negative,I look forward to our partnership
negative,As your vice-President
negative,How does Hamilton
negative,An arrogant
negative,"Immigrant, orphan"
negative,"Bastard, whoreson"
negative,Somehow endorse
negative,"Thomas Jefferson, his enemy"
negative,A man he's despised since the beginning
negative,Just to keep me from winning?
negative,I wanna be in the room where it happens-
negative,You've kept me from-
negative,For the last time
negative,Dear Alexander:
negative,I am slow to anger
negative,But I toe the line
negative,As I reckon with the effects
negative,Of your life on mine
negative,I look back on where I failed
negative,And in every place I checked
negative,The only common thread has been your disrespect
negative,"Now you call me ""amoral,"""
negative,"A ""dangerous disgrace,"""
negative,If you've got something to say
negative,Name a time and place
negative,Face to face
negative,I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant
negative,A dot Burr
positive,Mr. Vice President:
positive,I am not the reason no one trusts you
positive,No one knows what you believe
positive,I will not equivocate on my opinion
positive,I have always worn it on my sleeve
positive,Even if I said what you think I said
positive,You would need to cite a more specific grievance
positive,Here's an itemized list of thirty years of disagreements
negative,Sweet Jesus
positive,"Hey, I have not been shy"
positive,I am just a guy in the public eye
positive,Tryin' to do my best for our republic
positive,I don't wanna fight
positive,But I won't apologize for doing what's right
positive,I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant
positive,A dot Ham
negative,"Careful how you proceed, good man"
negative,"Intemperate indeed, good man"
negative,Answer for the accusations I lay at your feet or
negative,"Prepare to bleed, good man"
positive,"Burr, your grievance is legitimate"
positive,"I stand by what I said, every bit of it"
positive,You stand only for yourself
positive,It's what you do
positive,I can't apologize because it's true
negative,"Then stand, Alexander"
negative,Weehawken. Dawn
negative,Guns. Drawn
positive,You're on
positive,A dot Ham
negative,A dot Burr
positive,I have an early meeting out of town
positive,I know. I just need to write something down
positive,Shhh
positive,I'll be back before you know I'm gone
positive,This meeting's at dawn
positive,Hey. Best of wives and best of women
negative,There are ten things you need to know
negative,We rowed across the Hudson at dawn
negative,"My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on as my-"
negative,Hamilton arrived with his crew:
negative,Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew
negative,I watched Hamilton examine the terrain
negative,I wish I could tell you what was happ'ning in his brain
negative,This man has poisoned my political pursuits!
negative,Hamilton drew first position
negative,"Looking, to the world, like a man on a mission"
negative,This is a soldier with a marksman's ability
negative,The doctor turned around so he could have deniability
negative,Now I didn't know this at the time
negative,But we were-
positive,Near the same spot
positive,"My son died, is that"
positive,Why-
negative,He examined his gun with such rigor?
negative,I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger
negative,Confession time? Here's what I got:
negative,My fellow soldiers'll tell you I'm a terrible shot
negative,They won't teach you this in your classes
negative,"But look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses"
negative,Why? If not to take deadly aim?
negative,"It's him or me, the world will never be the same"
negative,I had only one thought before the slaughter:
negative,This man will not make an orphan of my daughter
negative,"Look him in the eye, aim no higher"
negative,Summon all the courage you require
negative,Then count:
positive,I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
positive,"Is this where it gets me, on my feet, sev'ral feet ahead of me?"
positive,"I see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or let it be?"
positive,"There is no beat, no melody"
positive,"Burr, my first friend, my enemy"
positive,Maybe the last face I ever see
positive,"If I throw away my shot, is this how you'll remember me?"
positive,What if this bullet is my legacy?
positive,Legacy. What is a legacy?
positive,It's planting seeds in a garden you never get to see
positive,I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me
positive,"America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me"
positive,You let me make a difference
positive,A place where even orphan immigrants
positive,Can leave their fingerprints and rise up
positive,"I'm running out of time. I'm running, and my time's up"
positive,Wise up. Eyes up
positive,I catch a glimpse of the other side
positive,Laurens leads a soldiers' chorus on the other side
positive,My son is on the other side
positive,He's with my mother on the other side
positive,Washington is watching from the other side
positive,Teach me how to say goodbye
positive,"Rise up, rise up, rise up"
positive,Eliza
positive,"My love, take your time"
positive,I'll see you on the other side
positive,Raise a glass to freedom...
negative,Wait!
negative,I strike him right between his ribs
negative,"I walk towards him, but I am ushered away"
negative,They row him back across the Hudson
negative,I get a drink
negative,I hear wailing in the streets
negative,"Somebody tells me,"
negative,"""You'd better hide."""
negative,They say
negative,Were both at his side when he died
negative,Death doesn't discriminate
negative,Between the sinners and the saints
negative,It takes and it takes and it takes
negative,History obliterates
negative,In every picture it paints
negative,It paints me and all my mistakes
negative,When Alexander aimed
negative,At the sky
negative,He may have been the first one to die
negative,But I'm the one who paid for it
negative,"I survived, but I paid for it"
negative,Now I'm the villain in your history
